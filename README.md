# SkateLog
This project was created for any skater who has passed by a spot either without their board, their crew, their filmer, or any other reason that made them think to themselves, "I have to come back and skate this!"

## What It Does
With SkateLog you can log every new spot you come across and save the exact latitude / longitude, notes about, date of, and picture of the spot. You can see all previously logged spots and instantly pull up past saved information for a given spot when you click on a marker.

### Made With
This project was made with Javascript, React, Node, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Axios, Google-Map-React, Google Cloud Platform, Webpack, Babel, CSS, and HTML (probably a few other smaller libraries too).

### Work in Progress
This project requires sensitive information from Google Cloud Platform API Token and AWS S3 bucket key configuration and password, so it will not work properly on your local machine. This project will be deployed on its own Amazon Web Services EC2 instance in the near future and the link will be posted accordingly.
